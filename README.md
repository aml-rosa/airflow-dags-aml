# Airflow DAGs - AML team

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/aml-rosa/airflow-dags-aml/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aml-rosa/airflow-dags-aml/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

this repo contains DAG (python files) for creating Airflow pipelines...to be used within our ODH deployment.  
First samples are taken from [official Airflow repo](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/v1-10-stable/airflow/example_dags) with tag **v1-10-stable** , since ODH includes Airflow v1.10.11....which is pretty old.
